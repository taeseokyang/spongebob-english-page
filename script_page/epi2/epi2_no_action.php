            <li><span>Plankton:</span>   You failed! I've finally stolen a Krabby Patty!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> That's nice. </li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Aren't you gonna try and take it back from me?</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Oh, goodness no. You go ahead. Take it.</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> But Mr. Krabs, Plankton will figure out the Krabby Patty formula.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span>  Nonsense.  Run along little fella. Enjoy your Krabby Patty.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Wow, you must've snapped Krabs.  The Krabby Patty formula is finally mine!  What happened? </li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Oh, just a little security measure I've been working on. Now all Krabby Patties self-destruct 10 feet beyond the Krusty Krab! Sucker!</li>
            <li><span>Sandals:</span>  Those Krabby Patties really hit the spot.</li>
            <li><span>Abigail Marge:</span> And next time you might wanna try chewing 'em. You're gonna blow up like a balloon.</li>
            <li><span>Sandals:</span> Haha, nonse— </li>
            <li><span>Abigail Marge:</span> He never listens to me.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Aw, man!  I stole the Krabby Patty fair and square!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Oh, poor wittle baby waby.  Does wittle Pwanksy wanksy need his nappy wappy? </li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> Why are you two always fighting? You were best palsie-walsies once. </li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Hey!</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> Can't you two make up and be friends?</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span>  Yeah, those day are over, SpongeBob.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Ooh... Krabs and I are bitter enemies!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> And that's the way we like it! </li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> If only there was some way to bring you two back together.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Forget it, SpongeBob. Nothin' will make me friend with Eugene Krabs.  What is that delicious smell!? </li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> Bluh! That doesn't smell delicious!</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> No, not that. It's coming from this way.  Aha. That delectable odor is coming from that shack.  Must know more!</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> The Flabby Patty?</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Another restaurant. Looks like Krabs has some real competition, huh..? Interesting.</li>
            <li><span>Harold:</span> Wow, a Flabby Patty. </li>

            <li><span>Plankton:</span> That was fantastic!  Forget the Krabby formula, I must have the Flabby Patty recipe! </li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span>  Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs, I have great news!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> The bank is handing out free samples of money?</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> Nooo. There's a new restaurant down the street called the Flabby Patty, and now Plankton only wants to steal their recipe. Isn't that wonderful?</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> What!? Some imitation patty is tryin' to steal me business?! Oh, but me customers are loyal.  They won't leave for some nasty Flabby Patty.  The Flabby Patty shack has stolen all me customers!</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Get used to it, Krabs. Your Krabby Patty is old news. Once I steal the Flabby Patty recipe your customers will be eating at the Chum Bucket!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Oh, no they won't, because I'll steal the Flabby Patty recipe first!</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Hey, stealin' recipes it my shtick. You haven't got a chance against me.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Ha! I bet I get that recipe way before you.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Bet ya don't!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Bet I will!</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Won't!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Will!</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span>  Whoa, whoa, whoa now. Instead of competing, why don't you cooperate and steal the recipe together?</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span>  You're a loser, Krabs.</li>

            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span>  That'll show ya— </li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> Don't you see?  If you work together, the Flabby Patty recipe would be yours.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> I'll never work with that melignorant microbe!</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Look what that skin flint did to my antennae!</li>

            <li><span>Fred:</span> So?</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> I'm a restaurant critic, so I get cutsies.</li>
            <li><span>Fred:</span> Cutsies? What's a cutsie?</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span>  I get to cut in line, so move aside, move aside!  What is this world coming to when a fake restaurant critic can't get cutsies?</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Okay, so here's the plan. I want you to—  I'm sorry, do you mind?  Let's go some place more private.  Once I stand in line I want you to—  Waitin' in line here. That's all.</li>
            <li><span>Fred:</span> Yeah, that's amazing.</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span>  Hello? I—I have an announcement to make!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Ooh, an announcement. We should listen. It might save your lives.</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span>  I need to— I'm okay.  The fish hooks are coming!</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Brilliant work, laddie.  Hey, how come you're not trampled?</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span>  That fool Krabs, he blew it again!  Now to steal the recipe.  Aha! There it is, and it isn't even guarded.  Huh? </li>
            <li><span>All:</span> Fish hooks! </li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Looks like you blew it again, Plankton.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> I did better than you, Eugene!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Says who?</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span>  Now, now, I think we all need to calm down. Fighting is pointless. You two would have the recipe by now if you only worked together.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span>  Okay, fine.  We'll work together.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Yeah, I don't see that workin' out.</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> Not to worry gentlemen. I have a plan.  Oh, yeah, perfect.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> We look ridiculous. Nobody's gonna buy this disguise.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span>  I agree!  This is a horrible idea! </li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> See? You guys are agreeing already. That's the first step to cooperation. </li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Okay, what's your stupid plan anyway?</li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> Look over there. </li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Little more. Little more.</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span> The Flabby Patty is hiring. If you can get the job, the recipe is yours.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span>  Why am I on the bottom?</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Stop whining! </li>
            <li><span>Chef:</span> Yes?</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Hello, I'm here to steal—no—darn... I mean, apply for a job. </li>
            <li><span>Chef:</span> You're hired. Your first assignment, memorize this recipe.  Well, I'm going on break. Keep and eye on the place.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Yes! The recipe is mine!</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Not so fast, Krabs!  Hahahaha!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span>  No you don't, Plankton!  Ah! Give it here!</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Oh, no, you don't!</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Both:</span> No...! </li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Yeah, you like that!</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> The recipe. We did it.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> We co-op-er-a-ted.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Now, let's see what's the flabby that's in this patty.</li>
            <li><span>Both:</span> Four pounds grade A love.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> One tablespoon listening. Two tablespoons... understanding? Mix ingredients thoroughly. Fold in warm heart. Sounds like a recipe for cannibalism.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Wait a minute, this isn't a recipe for patties. It's a recipe for friendship.</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>Chef:</span> You see, boys, this recipe is no secret. But I do have a surprise.</li>
            <li><span>No lines</span></li>
            <li><span>SpongeBob:</span>  Ta-dah! I started the Flabby Patty restaurant just to get you two rascals to team up, and so the power of friendship triumphs again!</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> What? You mean all this was one of your goofball schemes?</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> Now, now, Krabs, SpongeBob has taught us important life lessons, such as, oh, how to fall out of an airplane for instance.</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Yeah, and how to comically bludgeon myself.</li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> In fact, I think it's time we repay him, don't you?</li>
            <li><span>Mr. Krabs:</span> Great idea, pal.  We'll teach you about teamwork.  Get back here! </li>
            <li><span>Plankton:</span> We should do this more often, Krabs.</li>
